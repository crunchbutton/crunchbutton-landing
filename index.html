				When we started Crunchbutton in 2012, we set out to make the <b>food delivery</b> process as amazing and stress free as possible.
				<br><br> Over the years we built an awesome team of <b>developers</b>, <b>data-scientists</b>, and <b>product developers</b> to create a <b>food delivery platform</b> that we could all be proud of. From today forward, we are taking that very platform and all of our <b>software</b> we have created and making it completly <b>open source</b> and freely available to you.
				<br><br> Our team remains together, and lives on as the core behind <a href="http://ae.studio">http://ae.studio</a>, a product development and data science studio. Our passion to create great products, innovate, and be proud of what we do is as strong as ever. We look forward to working with all of you for your dev and data needs.
				<br><br> A huge thanks to our <b>customers</b>, <b>drivers</b>, investors, and our team. We are forever gratefull to all of you.
